                <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to open our hearts to the awakening of this practice called zazen in our everyday lives by providing a safe space for all beings in this growingly complex universe, and to cultivate and sustain an authentic lay Zen practice, fostering a community that embraces individuals of all ages, genders, cultures, and beliefs.</p>
                <p>This safe place is for the development of endless dimension universal life.</p>

                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p>Ocean Moon Sangha was established in 2004 in Santa Monica, California by John Daishin Buksbazen, Sensei. As a Soto Zen teacher, Daishin Sensei brought decades of practice and study to our community, creating a welcoming space for practitioners of all levels.</p>
                <p>Daishin Sensei received his teachings under the guidance of Taizan Maezumi Rōshi, one of the most influential Zen masters to teach in the West. He subsequently became a successor to Wendy Egyoku Nakao Rōshi. After many years of dedicated service to the sangha, Daishin Sensei retired in 2015.</p>
                <p>Today, Ocean Moon Sangha embraces both Rinzai and Soto Lineages, allowing for the embodiment of endless dimension universal life.</p>

                        <p>Mico Mushin Ryūtaku Olmos Rōshi first encountered Zen Buddhism during a family visit to Japan at age 6. Eighteen years later, while a Religious Studies major at Hunter College, he met Lou Mitsunen Nordstrom Rōshi, through whom he realized his deep affinity for Zen and began practice. During his first sesshin with Mitsunen Rōshi, Ryūtaku became Rōshi's student.</p>
                        <p>In 2001 Ryūtaku moved to Los Angeles with his wife and dog, but continued his training with Mitsunen Rōshi. Ryūtaku received Jukai in 2001 and Tokudo (monk ordination) in 2002 from Mitsunen Rōshi. He makes frequent trips to the Ryūgen-Ji and Hokori Zen Centers to study with Mitsunen Rōshi.</p>
                        <p>Ryūtaku began sitting with Ocean Moon Sangha in 2018. In 2019 Ryūtaku was named Dharma Holder by Mitsunen Rōshi, allowing him to teach. Ryūtaku assumed leadership of Ocean Moon Sangha in 2020 and worked hard to keep the Sangha sitting together on Zoom during the first 18 months of the COVID pandemic.</p>
                        <p>In 2021 Ryūtaku was given Dharma Transmission by Mitsunen Rōshi in the Rinzai Mushroom Monk Lineage of Sōen Nakagawa Rōshi. In 2023, in an intimate, informal ceremony, Mitsunen Rōshi gave Inka Shōmei in the Rinzai Mushroom Monk Lineage of Mitta-Kutsu Nakagawa Sōen Rōshi, presenting Ryūtaku with the title of Rōshi; he also presented Shiho in the White Plum Lineage to Ryūtaku.</p>
                        <p>Ryūtaku Rōshi currently lives in Venice, CA with his wife, three daughters, and two dogs.</p>

                        <h3>Mitsunen Kyōgen Rōshi</h3>
                        <p class="title">Lineage Teacher</p>
                        
                        <p>Lou Mitsunen Nordstrom Rōshi began practicing Zen in 1969. He earned a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Columbia University, where he taught until 1970. In 1974 he gave up a tenured position at Marymount College to become a Rinzai Zen monk with Eido Shimano Rōshi, and served as Eido Rōshi's head monk at Dai Bosatsu Zendo Kongo-ji in the Catskill Mountains between 1974 and 1976. During his time at Dai Bosatsu, he was also Sōen Nakagawa Rōshi's jisha.</p>
                        <p>This forged his life-long connection with Sōen Rōshi, from whom he would later receive Dharma Transmission (Inka Shōmei), in an intimate, informal ceremony in 1982. At this time Sōen Rōshi called Mitsunen "a true Zen Man." Mitsunen Rōshi put to use his academic skill set to edit the seminal work "Namu Dai Bosa: A Transmission of Zen Buddhism to America," an anthology of the works of Nyogen Senzaki, Sōen Nakagawa Rōshi, and Eido Shimano Rōshi, published in 1976.</p>
                        <p>During that year, Mitsunen Rōshi left Dai Bosatsu and returned to Manhattan to teach and live a "normal" life. But his desire for monastic life returned, and in 1980, he began studying with Taizan Maezumi Rōshi and Bernie Tetsugen Glassman Sensei. During this time, Maezumi Rōshi expressed his desire for Mitsunen to be his successor. He stayed in New York to help build the Zen Community of New York, where he served as director of Training, Liturgy and Study under Tetsugen Sensei. In 1983, Mitsunen received the formal written kirigami of Forbearance from Tetsugen promising Dharma transmission. In 1988 Mitsunen left Greyston and started leading Zen retreats at Southern Dharma Retreat Center, continuing until 1998.</p>
                        <p>In 1998, Mitsunen Rōshi received Dharma Transmission (Shiho) in the Soto White Plum Lineage from Tetsugen Rōshi. In 1999, he started leading retreats in Florida. In 2001, Mitsunen Rōshi founded Ryugen-Ji, Brevard Zen Center in Cocoa, Florida. In 2008, Mitsunen Rōshi founded Hokori-ji Zen Center in Lakeland, Florida, where he continues to lead retreats.</p>
                        <p>He has since published four books: "Zazen Without The Za," "Memoirs Of An American Zen Pioneer," "Painted Cakes," and "Raw and Open, Like a Wound." These collections of talks, essays, and memoirs span over 50 years of Zen practice and teaching.</p>

                        <p>Bernie Tetsugen Glassman Rōshi earned a Ph.D. in applied mathematics from University of California, Los Angeles, and was a founding member of Zen Center Los Angeles. He received Dharma transmission from Taizan Maezumi Rōshi in 1976.</p>
                        <p>In 1980, he founded the Zen Community of New York. In 1982 he opened the Greyston Bakery in Yonkers, New York, which initially provided support for his Zen students and evolved into an effort to help the unhoused community. The Greyston Bakery employed low-skilled workers, many of whom were unhoused, and sold baked goods to shops and restaurants in Manhattan.</p>
                        <p>In 1989, Tetsugen Rōshi entered into a relationship with Ben & Jerry's ice cream, supplying them with brownies for several different lines of ice cream. This afforded the creation of the not-for-profit 501(c)(3) Greyston Foundation, Inc. in 1992, which has continued to create jobs and serve the community.</p>

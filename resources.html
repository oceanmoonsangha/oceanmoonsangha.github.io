                <h2>How to Choose a Zen Teacher</h2>
                
                <p style="font-family: 'Cormorant Garamond', serif; font-size: 1.25rem; font-style: italic; color: #0f3460; margin-bottom: 2rem; padding-bottom: 2rem; border-bottom: 1px solid rgba(26, 26, 46, 0.1);">Choosing a Zen teacher is one of the most personal things you can ever do. This is someone you will trust with your deepest life wonders.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #0f3460; margin-top: 2rem;">Who was their teacher?</h3>
                <p>Zen teachers or masters do not spring up on their own. All teachers had teachers. Normally there is a lineage that is recognized and usually there is a record of this. (Remember, just because it is on the internet doesn't make it true.)</p>

                <h3 style="color: #0f3460; margin-top: 2rem;">How long have they studied?</h3>
                <p>It takes decades of practice to mature to the point where they are qualified to teach. Our own Mitsunen Rōshi, where our lineage came from, practiced for over 30 years before he was authorized. There is no "University of Zen" where you spend four years and receive a diploma making you a teacher. The process takes years of study, practice, and trials, and most individuals will never become teachers.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #0f3460; margin-top: 2rem;">Have they received Dharma Transmission or authority to teach, and from whom?</h3>
                <p>Dharma Transmission is a ceremony in which one's teacher confirms that an individual is ready and able to teach so-called others. In some traditions a master may authorize someone to teach on a very limited basis, such as meditation instruction only. In others, teachers are able to perform all life rituals.</p>

                <h3 style="color: #0f3460; margin-top: 2rem;">How do you contact their teacher or organization to confirm this?</h3>
                <p>All reputable Zen teachers are affiliated with some line or lineage. They will be glad to give you contact information to confirm their credentials. It is recommended that you at least check that your potential Sensei or Rōshi is listed on their teacher's website as authorized to teach. If you don't find them, don't get too worried; not everyone is on the web. You can always send an email to the Zen Center that your Sensei or Rōshi comes from and ask if they are authorized to teach.</p>

                    <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Our lineage</strong> starts with Lou Mitsunen Nordstrom Rōshi. He is authorized to teach in the lineage of the White Plum Sangha of Hakuyu Taizan Maezumi Rōshi, through Bernie Tetsugen Glassman Rōshi, and The Mushroom Monk Lineage of Sōen Nakagawa Rōshi.</p>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <p><strong style="color: #0f3460;">Hard Sell:</strong> If you find a teacher or group that is anxious to keep track of you, then beware. Zen does not do a hard sell. Neither your teacher nor the Zen group will try to keep you from leaving to try another group or teacher.</p>
                </div>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <p><strong style="color: #0f3460;">Money:</strong> A teacher and temple need money to survive. The money for a teacher is usually referred to as Dana (Selfless Giving). It is typically given anonymously to the teacher. It is not based on a list of fees for services. Everyone has something to give. In the event that you cannot financially contribute, your time and presence is usually more than enough. This zendo survives on a donation basis to cover rent and insurance. If you can't afford to donate, please continue to come. Donate what you can, when you can.</p>
                </div>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <p><strong style="color: #0f3460;">Promises of money, power, and long life:</strong> Unfortunately Zen will not be able to guarantee any of these things. If someone says they can, our advice is to leave. As with all groups, there tends to be a hierarchy. Zen has one too. But remember, a man or woman in monk's robes is just a man or a woman. A man or woman wearing a rakusu is just a man or woman. We are all just "beginners," every day! Do not think of someone as being more "advanced" than you just because they may have been at this a while.</p>
                </div>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <p><strong style="color: #0f3460;">There are no shortcuts in Zen!</strong> Despite what the popular press might be trying to tell you, anyone who guarantees enlightenment experience or kensho in a fixed or very short time period (or for that matter, at all) should be suspect.</p>
                </div>

                <div style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <p><strong style="color: #0f3460;">Ask Around:</strong> Choose the person you want for a teacher carefully. Just because you don't meet a teacher on the street every day doesn't mean they don't exist. Check with other temple members. There are several teachers located in the Los Angeles area. Some students have had good experiences with one teacher and not another. Remember, the right teacher can be a wonderful thing.</p>
